# Todo repo

- Check that removing bkchem/oasa does not break anything.
- Implement the PubChem lookup work in
  [docs/PUBCHEM_API_PLAN.md](docs/PUBCHEM_API_PLAN.md).
- Publish OASA to PyPI from the monorepo.
- Plan BKChem binary distribution (macOS dmg, Linux Flatpak, Windows installer).
- Mirror OASA modernization for BKChem (packaging metadata and version reporting).
- Mirror OASA modernization for BKChem (mypy configs and tests).
- Decide on BKChem mypy scope (baseline vs targeted) and add a BKChem mypy runner.
- Reconcile licensing guidance in [docs/REPO_STYLE.md](docs/REPO_STYLE.md) with
  GPLv2 repo policy.
- Document runtime dependencies consistently in
  [packages/bkchem/README.md](../packages/bkchem/README.md).
