# TODO

- Piddle was removed. Remove or replace Piddle-based exporters with Cairo
  equivalents where possible.
- Check that remove bkchem/oasa does not break anything
- deal with two plugins folders, distinguish them
-- ./packages/bkchem/plugins
-- ./packages/bkchem/bkchem/plugins
- Publish OASA to PyPI from the monorepo.
- Plan BKChem binary distribution (macOS dmg, Linux Flatpak, Windows installer).
