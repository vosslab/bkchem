# TODO

- Check that remove bkchem/oasa does not break anything
- Publish OASA to PyPI from the monorepo.
- Plan BKChem binary distribution (macOS dmg, Linux Flatpak, Windows installer).
- Mirror OASA modernization for BKChem (packaging metadata and version reporting).
- Mirror OASA modernization for BKChem (mypy configs and tests).
- Mirror OASA modernization for BKChem (pyflakes cleanup and globals refactors).
- Decide on BKChem mypy scope (baseline vs targeted) and add a BKChem mypy runner.
- Reconcile licensing guidance in [docs/REPO_STYLE.md](docs/REPO_STYLE.md) with GPLv2 repo policy.
- Document runtime dependencies consistently in [packages/bkchem/README.md](../packages/bkchem/README.md).
- Decide whether to remove the legacy PostScript builtin exporter once Cairo is required.
- Evaluate optional RDKit/Open Babel integration for expanded import/export formats.
  - Target formats: SDF/SD, MOL2, PDB, CIF.
  - Coverage notes:
    - RDKit: SDF/SD, MOL2, PDB; CIF support is limited.
    - Open Babel: SDF/SD, MOL2, PDB, CIF (broader format coverage).
  - Candidate entry points:
    - `packages/bkchem/bkchem/oasa_bridge.py` for conversion hooks.
    - `packages/bkchem/bkchem/plugins/` for optional import/export plugins.
    - `docs/SUPPORTED_FORMATS.md` to list any new formats.
