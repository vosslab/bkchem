## Overview

BKChem has a batch mode that runs a Python script without showing the main
window. Use the `-b` switch to run a script and exit:

```sh
bkchem -b path/to/script.py [args...]
```

Batch mode still initializes the Tk application. It requires a GUI environment
(even though the window is not displayed).

## How a batch script works

When BKChem runs a batch script it injects two globals. The structure is similar
to a [custom plugin](CUSTOM_PLUGINS.md):

- `App`: the live BKChem application instance.
- `Args`: a list of extra arguments passed after the script name.

The script can call any BKChem methods through `App` and can use normal Python
modules.

## Sample batch script

The example logic lives in `tests/run_bkchem_batch_examples.py`. It loads every
BKChem file under the given paths, sets the atom font size to 12, and re-saves
the files.

Key snippet:

```python
if app.load_CDML(path, replace=1):
	for mol in app.paper.molecules:
		for atom in mol.atoms:
			atom.font_size = 12
	app.save_CDML()
```

`App.load_CDML` returns true when the file is loaded successfully. The
`replace=1` argument reuses the current tab instead of opening a new one, which
keeps memory use lower during batch runs.
